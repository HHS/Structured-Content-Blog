<h1>Health and Human Services (HHS) Drupal Content Type Library: Internal Blog Post</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Internal Blog Post content type is used for blog posts posted by HHS Leadership and Staff and appear in the HHS Blog section of the website. Tags are identified for each blog post for Category and Keyword Tags. Sorting is enabled so that all blog posts tagged with a particular tag or category can be found on a filtered view page. This content type should only be used by blog posts written by HHS that should appear in the HHS Blog section. Blog posts for localized blogs should use a different content type.

<h2>Content Type Details</h2>
Contained in the /documentation folder are the content model for Internal Blog Post content type (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-InternalBlogPost.xlsx) which includes the Drupal field names used and their matching schema.org metadata name; and a Word Template (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Template-InternalBlogPost.docx), which is a guidance document we provide to content owners to complete whenever they want an Internal Blog Post to be created. The Template includes all of the fields that must be completed in order to create the Blog Post. The Template document is also used for External Blog Posts, which are blog posts copied from other HHS entities to be included in the HHS Blog feed.
